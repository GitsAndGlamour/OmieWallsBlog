# OmieWallsBlog
A Web-blog/portfolio for an up-and-comming developer.

The blog will feature snippet templates for the header, footer, sidenav, and 
section.

The section will be interchangeable and display; blog.tpl, about.tpl, resume.tpl, 
portfolio.tpl, and training.tpl

A DIV overlay will hold the contact.tpl, which is not illustrated in the 'views' 
folder. 

Responsive Design will affect mainly the sidenav.tpl file in terms of the menu 
layout.

Wireframe diagrams have been made to illustrate the web layout and certain content 
features that will be used.
